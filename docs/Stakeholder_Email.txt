Subject: Status — Fall Refresh variants; small blocker on API provisioning

Hi <FirstName>,

Quick status on **Fall Refresh** (US, MX):
- Generated **14/18** planned variants across 1:1, 9:16, 16:9.
- Missing **4** (9:16) for *Cool Lime* due to GenAI API quota still in provisioning.

What we’re doing
- Queued retries and a lighter layout that reuses the existing hero so Ad Ops isn’t stuck.
- Rerun will auto‑resume once the quota is raised.

What we need
- **IT:** confirm Firefly API quota + workspace access for the service account.
- **Creative:** thumbs‑up on the alternate 9:16 layout if the quota slips past today.

Next update in ~30 minutes or sooner if we’re unblocked. The run report (counts, flags, thumbnails) lives in the shared folder.

Thanks,  
Oliver
