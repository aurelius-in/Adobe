# 0003 — Compliance scope for PoC
**Date:** 2025-09-20

**Context**
We want guardrails without over‑engineering governance.

**Decision**
Check three things: logo presence/area (3–6%), primary color presence via HSV window, contrast ≥ 4.5:1.

**Consequences**
- Quick signal for brand/legals.
- A few false positives/negatives are fine for now.
- Real production would add per‑brand rules + approvals.
